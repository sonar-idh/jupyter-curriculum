Please remember that the notebooks you create new won't be saved when you run this project on binder. However, you can download a notebook you write yourself and use it outside this project.\n",

    "The other files in this project are not necessarily important for you - they provide some setup information about the project itself, so it is reproducable on any machine. When you just want to follow along the curriculum you do not need to care about these files.\n",

    "**3. The browser ribbon**\n",
