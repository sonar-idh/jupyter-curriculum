In this case it is returning a character string called `Hello {}, how are you?`. <br>Right after the character string there is `.format(to)`. This is called a `method`. As discussed in [Section 2.2.1](#text-type) there are different things you can do with variables in dependance of the respective data type or class. Character strings in Python have plenty different methods (a kind of sub-function that only works for character strings). One of these methods is `format()`. `format()` can be used to replace a placeholder in a character string with a specified value. <br>\n",

    "Inside the return string `\"Hello {}, how are you?\"` there are curly brackets (`{}`) - this is the placeholder `format()` replaces with the specified value that is passed as an argument into `format()`. In the examle above we pass the argument `to` into `format()` - `to` has the deafult value `Everyone` und thus the resulting string that our function returns when calling `hello()` is `Hello Everyone, how are you?`"
