    "## Origin\n",
    "\n",
    "The Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler is considered to be the origin of graph studies. In 1735, he published a paper proposing a solution for the \"Königsberg problem\". The Königsberg problem was a mathematical problem, unsolved at this point of time.\n",
    "Euler developed a new analysis technique to tackle this problem and thus was able to prove that there is no solution for the Königsberg problem. This new technique was the origin of the graph theory we know today. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a look at the Königsberg problem: \n",
    "\n",
    "**Königsberg Problem** \n",
    "\n",
    ">Given the city whose geography is depicted in the following image, is there a way to walk across each of the seven bridges of the city once and only once, and return to our starting point? <cite data-cite=\"7184373/UCHCU3AD\"></cite>\n",
    "\n",
    "<center>\n",
    "    <img src=\"../images/notebook2/01-1_kb_base.png\", width=\"238\">\n",
    "    <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Konigsberg_bridges.png\">Image Source</a>\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "The city is crossed by a river that splits the city into multiple parts. There are two banks (above and below the river) and additionally the river creates two islands (the rectangle in the middle and the one at the very right-hand side). Those two banks and two islands are connected by a total of seven bridges (highlighted in green). \n",
    "\n",
    "Euler's approach was reducing this problem to the most simple drawing (see picture below). The idea was that each of the four city parts (two banks & two islands) is considered a single point (*node*). And each of the points is connected to another by one or more links (*edges*).\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "<center>\n",
    "    <img src=\"../images/notebook2/01-2_kb_nodes.png\", width=\"238\">\n",
    "    <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:K%C3%B6nigsberg_graph.svg\">Image Source</a> (Labels added by the author)\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on this simplified picture of the problem Euler noted that, if you arrive at one point via one link, you need to leave it using another link (except for the starting and ending point). \n",
    "This means that all points but two need to be connected to an even number of links. The Königsberg problem has the following connections:\n",
    "\n",
    "| City Part | Connection |\n",
    "|--- |----------|\n",
    "| A | twice to C; once to D |\n",
    "| B | twice to C; once to D       |\n",
    "| C | twice to A; twice to B, once to D|\n",
    "| D | once to A; once to C; once to D|\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As can be seen in the figute above, the condition (*all points but two need to be connected to an even number of links*) is not true in the Königsberg problem, and hence there is no solution for it.\n",
    "\n",
    "This schematic approach to solve the problem was since further developed and applied to other problems and resulted in the **Graph Theory** we know today.\n"
