    "## Origin\n",
    "\n",
    "The Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler is considered to be the origin of graph studies. In 1735, he published a paper proposing a solution for the \"Königsberg problem\". The Königsberg problem was a mathematical problem, unsolved at this point of time.\n",
    "Euler developed a new analysis technique to tackle this problem and thus was able to prove that there is no solution for the Königsberg problem. This new technique was the origin of the graph theory we know today. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a look at the Königsberg problem: \n",
    "\n",
    "**Königsberg Problem** \n",
    "\n",
    ">Given the city whose geography is depicted in the following image, is there a way to walk across each of the seven bridges of the city once and only once, and return to our starting point? (Scifo and Safari, 2020)\n",
    "\n",

    "    <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Konigsberg_bridges.png\">Image Source</a>\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "The city is crossed by a river that splits the city into multiple parts. There are two banks (above and below the river) and additionally the river creates two islands (the rectangle in the middle and the one at the very right-hand side). Those two banks and two islands are connected by a total of seven bridges (highlighted in green). \n",
    "\n",
    "Euler's approach was reducing this problem to the most simple drawing (see picture below). The idea was that each of the four city parts (two banks & two islands) is considered a single point (*node*). And each of the points is connected to another by one or more links, also called *edges* (ibid.).\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>\n",

    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on this simplified picture of the problem Euler noted that, if you arrive at one point via one link, you need to leave it using another link (except for the starting and ending point). \n",
    "This means that all points but two need to be connected to an even number of links. The Königsberg problem has the following connections:\n",
    "\n",
    "| City Part | Connection |\n",
    "|--- |----------|\n",
    "| A | twice to C; once to D |\n",
    "| B | twice to C; once to D       |\n",
    "| C | twice to A; twice to B, once to D|\n",
    "| D | once to A; once to C; once to D|\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As can be seen in the figure above, the condition (*all points but two need to be connected to an even number of links*) is not true in the Königsberg problem, and hence there is no solution for it.\n",
    "\n",
    "This schematic approach to solve the problem was since further developed and applied to other problems and resulted in the **Graph Theory** we know today.\n"

Further more *scale-free networks* occur especially in contexts where a hub-and-spoke architecture is present.

The book starts with an introduction to the basics of graph analytics, the Cypher query language, and graph architecture components, and helps you to understand why enterprises have started to adopt graph analytics within their organizations. You'll find out how to implement Neo4j algorithms and techniques and explore various graph analytics methods to reveal complex relationships in your data. You'll be able to implement graph analytics catering to different domains such as fraud detection, graph-based search, recommendation systems, social networking, and data management. You'll also learn how to store data in graph databases and extract valuable insights from it. As you become well-versed with the techniques, you'll discover graph machine learning in order to address simple to complex challenges using Neo4j. You will also understand how to use graph data in a machine learning model in order to make predictions based on your data. Finally, you'll get to grips with structuring a web application for production using Neo4j. By the end of this book, you'll not only be able to harness the power of graphs to handle a broad range of problem areas, but you'll also have learned how to use Neo4j efficiently to identify complex relationships in your data. What you will learn Become well-versed with Neo4j graph database building blocks, nodes, and relationships Discover how to create, update, and delete nodes and relationships using Cypher querying Use graphs to improve web search and recommendations Understand graph algorithms such as pathfinding, spatial search, centrality, and community detection Find out different steps to integrate graphs in a normal machine learning pipeline Formulate a link prediction problem in the context of machine learning Implement graph embedding algorithms such as DeepWalk, and use them in Neo4j graphs Who this book is for This book is for data analysts, bus...",
